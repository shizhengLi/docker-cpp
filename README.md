# Docker-CPP: Container Runtime in C++

A high-performance container runtime implementation in modern C++, following TDD principles.

## Project Overview

This project aims to reimplement Docker functionality using C++20/23, leveraging the language's performance advantages and systems programming capabilities. The implementation follows a test-driven development (TDD) approach with comprehensive unit tests.

- **Performance Testing**: High-frequency event processing (10,000+ events under 1 second)

#### ✅ Critical System Fixes Applied
- **Plugin Deadlock Resolution**: Fixed dependency resolution deadlock in `getLoadOrder()` method
- **Configuration Layering**: Corrected configuration hierarchy and priority ordering
- **Thread Safety**: Added recursive mutex protection for concurrent access
- **Environment Variable Expansion**: Proper handling of missing variables with fallback preservation
