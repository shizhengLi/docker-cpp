# Docker-CPP: Container Runtime in C++

A high-performance container runtime implementation in modern C++, following TDD principles.

## Project Overview

This project aims to reimplement Docker functionality using C++20/23, leveraging the language's performance advantages and systems programming capabilities. The implementation follows a test-driven development (TDD) approach with comprehensive unit tests.

## Current Status: Week 1 Infrastructure Complete ✅

### 🎯 Week 1 Achievements (Project Setup and Infrastructure)

#### ✅ Professional Build System
- **CMake Configuration**: Modern CMake 3.20+ with Conan 2.0 package management
- **Cross-Platform CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline supporting Linux and macOS
- **Code Quality Tools**: Integrated clang-format, clang-tidy, and cppcheck
- **Package Management**: Automated dependency resolution with Conan
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Google Test 1.14.0 integration with comprehensive test coverage

#### ✅ Development Workflow
- **Professional Project Structure**: Clean separation of source, include, tests, and build artifacts
- **Automated Testing**: 14/14 tests passing (7 core + 5 namespace + 1 cgroup + 1 integration)
- **Code Quality Gates**: Static analysis, formatting checks, and security scanning
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and development guidelines

#### ✅ Core Framework Implementation
- **Error Handling**: Professional exception hierarchy with `ContainerError` and `ErrorCode`
- **Namespace Management**: RAII-based Linux namespace wrappers with macOS mock support
- **Testing Framework**: Complete test suite with TDD principles
- **Build Artifacts**: Professional packaging and release management

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Compiler**: C++20 compatible (GCC 11+, Clang 14+)
- **CMake**: Version 3.20 or higher
- **Conan**: Package manager (pip install conan==2.0.16)
- **Python**: For Conan package management

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/shizhengLi/docker-cpp.git
cd docker-cpp

# Install dependencies
conan install . --build=missing

# Configure with CMake preset
cmake --preset conan-release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON

# Build project
cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc 2>/dev/null || sysctl -n hw.ncpu || echo 4)

# Run all tests
ctest --preset conan-release --parallel $(nproc 2>/dev/null || sysctl -n hw.ncpu || echo 4)

# Or run tests directly
./tests/tests-core
./tests/tests-namespace
./tests/tests-cgroup
./tests/tests-integration
```

### Alternative Build (Makefile)
```bash
# Setup development environment
make setup

# Build project
make

# Run tests
make test

# Clean build
make clean
```
