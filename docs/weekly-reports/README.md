## Current Sprint: Weeks 5-6 - Container Runtime Engine

### Objectives
- Implement core container lifecycle management
- Create container state machine
- Establish container configuration system

### Key Components to Implement
1. **Container Runtime Core**
   - Container creation, start, stop, removal
   - State management and transitions
   - Configuration validation and parsing

2. **Container Registry**
   - Container metadata management
   - Process tracking and monitoring
   - Resource allocation tracking

3. **Container Execution Engine**
   - Process spawning with namespace/cgroup setup
   - Environment configuration
   - Signal handling and process lifecycle

### Success Criteria
- Container lifecycle operations work correctly
- State transitions are atomic and consistent
- Configuration validation is comprehensive
- Event system tracks all container operations
- 100% test coverage with TDD approach
- CI/CD pipeline passes all quality checks

## Development Principles

### üéØ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Red**: Write failing tests first
- **Green**: Make tests pass with minimal implementation
- **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
- **100% Test Coverage**: All code must be thoroughly tested

### üîÑ Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **Automated Testing**: All code changes must pass CI
- **Code Quality**: Zero warnings from static analysis tools
- **Performance**: Automated performance regression testing
- **Security**: Automated security scanning and vulnerability checking

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Loosely coupled, highly cohesive components
- **RAII**: Resource management through object lifetime
- **Exception Safety**: Strong exception guarantees throughout
- **Thread Safety**: All components designed for concurrent access
- **Performance**: Zero-overhead abstractions where possible

### üìä Quality Standards
- **Static Analysis**: clang-tidy and cppcheck with zero warnings
- **Code Formatting**: clang-format with consistent style
- **Memory Safety**: AddressSanitizer and Valgrind verification
- **Performance**: Benchmarks for all critical paths
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### Completed Improvements
- ‚úÖ Resolved all clang-tidy warnings (from 351,581 to 0)
- ‚úÖ Fixed all cppcheck issues with version alignment
- ‚úÖ Optimized CI/CD pipeline performance
- ‚úÖ Established code quality gates

### Ongoing Focus Areas
- Performance optimization and profiling
- Memory usage optimization
- Documentation completeness
- Developer experience improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Week 5-6 implementation with TDD approach
2. **Short-term**: Complete Phase 2 core runtime features
3. **Medium-term**: Implement Phase 3 advanced features
4. **Long-term**: Achieve production readiness in Phase 4
