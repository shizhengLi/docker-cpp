## Current Sprint: Complete Week 2-4 Framework Implementations

### Immediate Objectives
- **Complete Week 2**: Finish plugin system implementation and add comprehensive tests
- **Complete Week 3**: Implement actual Linux namespace wrappers (replace mock implementations)
- **Complete Week 4**: Implement cgroup management system functionality

### Priority Tasks
1. **Week 2 Completion**
   - Fill in missing plugin system functionality
   - Add comprehensive test coverage for all Week 2 components
   - Ensure all configuration management features work correctly

2. **Week 3 Implementation**
   - Replace mock namespace implementations with actual Linux system calls
   - Implement process manager with proper process lifecycle management
   - Add RAII namespace management with proper error handling

3. **Week 4 Implementation**
   - Implement cgroup manager with actual cgroup filesystem operations
   - Implement resource monitoring with real system metrics
   - Add cgroup hierarchy management functionality

## Next Phase: Core Runtime Implementation (Weeks 5-12) - POSTPONED

| Week | Status | Focus Area | Priority |
|------|--------|------------|----------|
| Weeks 5-6 | ‚è≥ Postponed | Container Runtime Engine | HIGH |
| Weeks 7-8 | ‚è≥ Postponed | Image Management System | HIGH |
| Weeks 9-10 | ‚è≥ Postponed | Network Stack | MEDIUM |
| Weeks 11-12 | ‚è≥ Postponed | Storage Engine | MEDIUM |

### Success Criteria (for Current Sprint)
- All Week 2-4 components have complete working implementations
- Mock implementations are replaced with actual system calls
- Namespace and cgroup management work on Linux systems
- 100% test coverage for all implemented components
- CI/CD pipeline passes all quality checks

### Future Success Criteria (for Weeks 5-12)
- Container lifecycle operations work correctly
- State transitions are atomic and consistent
- Configuration validation is comprehensive
- Event system tracks all container operations
- Container runtime engine is fully functional

## Development Principles

### üéØ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Red**: Write failing tests first
- **Green**: Make tests pass with minimal implementation
- **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
- **100% Test Coverage**: All code must be thoroughly tested

### üîÑ Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **Automated Testing**: All code changes must pass CI
- **Code Quality**: Zero warnings from static analysis tools
- **Performance**: Automated performance regression testing
- **Security**: Automated security scanning and vulnerability checking

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Loosely coupled, highly cohesive components
- **RAII**: Resource management through object lifetime
- **Exception Safety**: Strong exception guarantees throughout
- **Thread Safety**: All components designed for concurrent access
- **Performance**: Zero-overhead abstractions where possible

### üìä Quality Standards
- **Static Analysis**: clang-tidy and cppcheck with zero warnings
- **Code Formatting**: clang-format with consistent style
- **Memory Safety**: AddressSanitizer and Valgrind verification
- **Performance**: Benchmarks for all critical paths
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### Completed Improvements
- ‚úÖ Resolved all clang-tidy warnings (from 351,581 to 0)
- ‚úÖ Fixed all cppcheck issues with version alignment
- ‚úÖ Optimized CI/CD pipeline performance
- ‚úÖ Established code quality gates

### Current Technical Debt
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mock implementations**: Namespace manager has macOS mock implementations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Empty placeholders**: Process manager, cgroup manager, and resource monitor are empty
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing functionality**: Several core components exist as headers but lack implementations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Inconsistent completion**: Week 2 is substantially complete, Weeks 3-4 are mostly empty

### Ongoing Focus Areas
- Complete implementation of all placeholder components
- Replace mock implementations with actual Linux system calls
- Add comprehensive test coverage for implemented components
- Performance optimization and profiling
- Memory usage optimization
- Documentation completeness

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Complete Week 2-4 implementations (replace mocks and empty placeholders)
2. **Short-term**: Move to Phase 2 container runtime implementation once foundation is solid
3. **Medium-term**: Implement Phase 3 advanced features
4. **Long-term**: Achieve production readiness in Phase 4
