# CI/CD and Code Quality Documentation

This directory contains our hard-won lessons and best practices for setting up C++ CI/CD pipelines with static analysis tools.

### [Our Journey with Cppcheck, Clang-Tidy, and CI/CD: Lessons from the Trenches](./our-journey-with-cppcheck-clang-tidy-and-ci-cd.md)
A detailed blog post documenting our complete journey from naive setup to a robust, optimized CI/CD pipeline. Covers:

- The 351,581 warning disaster and how we fixed it
- Gitignore pitfalls that cost us days
- Version hell between local and CI environments
- Performance optimization techniques
- Preprocessor directive challenges
- Variable naming mistakes and their solutions

### [Quick Reference Guide](./quick-reference-guide.md)
A practical, hands-on guide with working configurations and commands you can copy-paste. Includes:

- Essential commands for daily development
- Working .clang-tidy and CI configurations
- Common problems and their solutions
- Best practices checklist
- Troubleshooting guide

## üéØ Key Takeaways

### The Pain Points We Endured
1. **351,581 clang-tidy warnings** - from wildcard configurations
2. **Gitignore disasters** - entire directories excluded
3. **Version mismatches** - different tool versions locally vs CI
4. **Performance nightmares** - 20+ minute CI runs
5. **False positives** - tools reporting non-existent errors

### The Solutions We Found
1. **Specific over general** - targeted checks instead of wildcards
2. **Version consistency** - identical tool versions everywhere
3. **Performance optimization** - parallel processing and selective analysis
4. **Static-analysis-friendly code** - tool-aware programming practices
5. **Iterative improvement** - start small, expand gradually

## üöÄ Quick Start

If you're setting up a new C++ project with CI/CD:

1. **Read the journey first** - understand why certain decisions were made
2. **Use the quick reference** - copy working configurations
3. **Adapt to your project** - modify based on your specific needs
4. **Test locally** - always run the same tools locally before pushing

## üìñ Context

These documents are based on our experience with the [Docker-CPP project](../../README.md), a modern C++ container runtime implementation. The project uses:

- **C++20** with modern features
- **CMake** build system
- **Google Test** for testing
- **Conan** for dependency management
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Versions

Our final working configuration uses:

- **clang-format**: 15.0.7
- **clang-tidy**: 15.0.7
- **cppcheck**: 2.18.0 (built from source)

## üí° Why This Matters

Setting up robust CI/CD for C++ projects is notoriously difficult. Static analysis tools are powerful but complex, and the learning curve is steep. We spent months struggling with these issues so you don't have to.

Our goal with these documents is to help others avoid the same pitfalls and set up effective code quality pipelines quickly and reliably.

**Remember**: Good code quality tools are enablers, not obstacles. The right configuration makes development faster and more reliable.
